#RESTful APIs with JAX-RS


Done with eclipse 

Used tomcat v8.5 

Check Documentation for Handling Exceptions

Did not check the HATEAOS part + Content Negociation

Note:

WebApplication Exception = jax-rs exception => no need to map the exceptions, jax-rs already knows 

Also check its children exception
